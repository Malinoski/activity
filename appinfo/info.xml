		This application enables users to view actions related to their files in ownCloud.
		Once enabled, users will see a new icon “Ooba” in their apps menu.
		When clicked, a new page appears for users to track the ooba related to files – from new files, to deleted files, move, rename, updates and shared ooba.
		The user can configure their individual ooba settings in their personal menu.
		This sets the type of ooba to record, as well as whether to the user sees their own oobas,
		whether these are only available online, and whether they get an email digest on a regular basis.
		More information is available in the Ooba documentation.
